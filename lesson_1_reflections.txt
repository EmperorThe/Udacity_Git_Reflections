was introduced?

efficient programmer in the long term?

    Spend less time worring about changes adversly affecting the code without being able to go back.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro: Commits at logical points. Con: Might forget to commit.

files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    GIT is orianted towards Projects. Google Docs is orianted towards individual Docs.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    By typing them in.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If you break it you can go back and view the code from previous commits
